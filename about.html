       <strong> I choose IT out of curiosity. </strong><br>
Ever since I was a kid I am always fascinated how technology works,<br> 
intrigued about how technology affects humans.

an answers,

 and the eager to learn about certain things, 
Interested of what logic and challenges behind every programs, games, and websites,
How they could make it easier to use for each individuals.
I choose IT out of curiosity for each
unlimited learnings,
for challenges I wanted to face. for everyday logics,
and for those tiring days, i wanted to experience those things,
 to challenge 
myself to go beyond my limition, to create and to experience, to enjoy, for

 Because of this curiousity i was
eager to understand, to achieve the things I wanted in life.

The feelings I have towards this course 
was something interesting. I wanted to be able to comprehend each challenge and logic behind 
every programs,

 This helps me to find the things
I wanted in life
and in each generations technology
will becoming more advance,
so as its program. I wanted to take this oppurtinity
to learn its system and to create.
I always Idolize my cuzins for his intelligence in computer programming, and that motivate me to learn and to keep up with him.<br>
and so as I grew older I have grasp a better comprehension towards this
curiousity, its not just being curious its something I wanna do,
